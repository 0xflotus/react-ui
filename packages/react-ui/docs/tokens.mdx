`react-ui` embraces constraints based design. 

<br/>

### What is constraints based design? 

Constraints based design is a methodology borrowed from the world of design systems. 

In practice this looks like keeping all design decisions in a single file/folder for everyone on the project to consume.

The key benefits of this approach is having a set of good options that you can choose from, instead of making design decisions on the fly leading to a consistent and predictable interface.

It also serves as a place for a place for designers and developers in your team to collaborate on decisions.

<br/>

`react-ui` utilises the [System UI Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme/) which is object based.

The first layer of this is to create a set of variables for yourself.

```js
const theme = {
  fontSizes: [0, 11, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 72],
  space: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40],
  lineHeights: { ... },
  radii: [ ... ],
  colors: {
    white: '#fff',
    reds: {
      100: '#F8E4E4',
      200: '#EFA6A6',
      300: '#E06161',
      400: '#D95252',
      500: '#D12D2D',
      600: '#B41F1F',
      700: '#A20808',
      800: '#821919',
      900: '#5E1717'
    },
    grays:  { ... }
    blues:  { ... },
    greens: { ... },
  }
}
```

<br/>

The second layer is to encode design decisions in your theme. These decisions are consumed by components.


```js
// variables
const theme = { ... }

// decisions
theme.colors.text = {
  subtle: theme.colors.grays[700],
  body: theme.colors.grays[800],
  link: theme.colors.blues[500],
  linkHover: theme.colors.blues[600]
}
theme.colors.error = {
  background: theme.colors.reds[100],
  border: theme.colors.reds[300],
  text: theme.colors.reds[800]
}
```

<br/>

In your project, these decisions can span to multiple components.


<div className="example preview-first">

![error tokens in form](/docs/form-error.png)

```jsx
<Form>
  <Input type="text" error="This field cannot be blank">
</Form>
```

</div>

<div className="example">

![error tokens in alert](/docs/alert-error.png)

```jsx
<Alert>Your account is not active</Alert>
```
</div>

This practice of encoding decisions and then using them in components leads to a user interface that feels more consistent. The benefits of encoding design decisions are more visible in teams as these decisions get used not only across pages but across people.

Bonus: If your application/blog has multiple themes, you would be able to create them by writing variations of the decision layer for colors while keeping the variables layer fixed.




<br/>

### Why should you bother?

**For developers:**

If you are working alone on a project or prototype, this approach lets you make design choices once and then focus on more important parts for your project like building features.

`react-ui` ships with a beautiful default theme if you want to focus on the features first and refine the design later.

Having a constraints based approach not only makes you more productive but also gives you a way of refining the design of the project in a continous manner.

Example: Changing the color of your links across anchors, buttons, tooltips etc. is a one line change in a single file instead of it being spread across the codebase.

<br/>

**For teams:**

The benefits are even bigger when you're working in a team alongside designers or other developers, encoding decisions in a single source of truth is incredibily powerful. It reduces the friction involved in communicating UI specification by speaking the same language and leads to a more consistent interface.

This also lets you _design_ together as a team. If a certain color fails to meet the accessibility benchmarks your team has decided, you can move further down the scale to a color that is already on your pre-decided palette.

```diff
const styles = {
-   color: 'reds.500'
+   color: 'reds.600'
}
```

Bonus points if you can bring your designers onboard to contribute and _own_ this part of the codebase.

<br/>

### Iterate over design decisions

It can feel very daunting to make these design decisions at the start of the project when you're still figuring what to build.

The goal of `react-ui` isnt to have the design decisions right the first time, but to be able to iterate over them in a predictable manner without breaking the UI.

Example: Let's say you decide to change the 2nd font size on your scale, you can find all the places in your codebase which are impacted by that decision by looking up `fontSizes: 2`

Another strategy that works well early on is to make decisions inside a component file as you're building them and then overtime graduate them to the theme.
