title: Goals and Scope
---

Fast protyping with long term maintenance

### Goals

- Look good out of the box

  Someone looking for a set of reusable components for prototyping should not have to spend time styling the components.

- Customisation as a first class citizen

  There should be a straightforward path to making the library feel like part of your application.

- Library components should be _high quality_

  All components should look good, be composable, accessibile and responsive.

- Opinionated way of extending the library

  New components created by the developers using the library should feel part of the _system_ of components.

#### Stretch goals

- Feel approachable for both developers and designers

  The library should make design more approachable to developers and code more approachable to designers.

- Promote an ecosystem of high quality components

  Larget superset of _contributed_ components that are reviwed for the above _quality_ goals (react-ui extension pack?)

<br />

Enabling the above goals would be easier if there are some constraints but in place first.

### Scope/Constraints:

- constraints based design

  This is a concept _stolen_ from the world of design systems. Baking decisions in a file leads to consistent and predictable UI by giving a common language to designers and developers. [Read more](/docs/constraints).

- css-in-js first, css in css later

  It would be very important to have both React components and readable class names for HTML. Custom properties (css variables) are a great fit for constraint based design. But in the short term, focusing on just one method would get this further.

- javascript first, typescript later

  I'm not an expert on typescript and would like to create an API that works everywhere without getting biased by what works well with typescript today.

- web first, native later

  Same story as above, I'm not an expert on React Native and it would be a distraction to try to do too many things at once. Never say never though.

<br />

The above constraints do exclude some developers/teams and I'd hope to iterate over and increase the scope of the project to welcome more people.
