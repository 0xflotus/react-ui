title: Creating new composite component
---

import { ThemeProvider, Element, Text, Link, Input } from 'react-ui'

<br />

More often than creating new building blocks, you'll find yourself creating new components composed of built-in components from `react-ui`.

As an example, let's build a `Breadcrumbs` component.

(This guide assumes you have read the first part about [creating new building blocks](/docs/recipes/building-block))

<br />

This is what we would like our breadcrumbs component to look like:

<div className="example preview-first preview-margin">

<ThemeProvider>
  <Element
    as="div"
    aria-label="breadcrumb"
    css={{
      fontSize: 3,
      Link: {
        ':after': {
          content: "'/'",
          color: 'text.subtle',
          paddingX: 2
        }
      }
    }}
  >
    <Link href="/home">Home</Link>
    <Link href="/settings">Settings</Link>
    <span aria-current>Update profile details</span>
  </Element>
</ThemeProvider>

```jsx
<Breadcrumbs>
  <Link href="/home">Home</Link>
  <Link href="/settings">Settings</Link>
  <span aria-current>Update profile details</span>
</Breadcrumbs>
```

</div>

Our component needs to set the font size of it's component and add a separator(`/`) after each link.

<br />

**Step 1: Breadcrumb styles**

To begin, let's create a new component like we did earlier on this page with the `Element` primitive.

We have added the font size we want our breadcrumb to have.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Element } from 'react-ui'

const styles = {
  fontSize: 3
}

const Breadcrumbs = props => (
  <Element as="div" css={styles} {...props}>
    {props.children}
  </Element>
)
```

Note: this guide does not show you how to create an accessible breadcrumb. To see the full implementation, see the [Breadcrumbs component](/docs/components/breadcrumbs) from `react-ui`

<br />

**Step 2: Add additional styles to Link**

The styles we provide to a component build with the `Element` primitive supports nesting.

We can customise what styles are added to the `Link` component when it is present inside the `Breadcrumbs` component like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Element } from 'react-ui'

const styles = {
  fontSize: 3,
  // we can target the Link component by its data-component
  Link: {
    ':after': {
      content: "'/'",
      color: 'text.subtle',
      paddingX: 2
    }
  }
}

const Breadcrumbs = props => (
  <Element as="div" css={styles} {...props}>
    {props.children}
  </Element>
)
```

If you'd like to use this method for components you build yourself, refer to the documentation for [making components customisable](/docs/recipes/creating-components/#step-3-optional-make-the-component-customisable)
